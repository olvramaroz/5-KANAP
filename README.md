<h2>How to operate this project ?</h2>
<h3>Back end Prerequisites</h3>
You will need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine.

<h3>Back end Installation</h3>
Clone this repo. <mark>From the "back" folder</mark> of the project, run <i>npm install</i>. You can then run the server with <i>node server</i>. The server should run on localhost with default port 3000. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. Listening on port 3001.

<h2>First Javascript project !</h2>
This is my first Javascript project ever.
That is why you will see a lot of comments in my codes.
They help me to better understand my codes and it could be helpful later when I will come back to this.
